All were yummy and delecious.. thanks for good hospitality.\n",
      "Vandana Choudhary 5 Few days back I visited this restro which had ancient style decor. I was really impressed with the decor and vibrant ambience. In starters I had achari paneer tikka which was spicy and delicious. I got to try dahi ke sholey and they were really soft and yummy. In veg platter too I tasted some great starters including tandoori aloo, mushroom and paneer tikka. Then I tried paneer tikka pizza which was one of the best pizzas, with crispy crust and paneer cubes and veggies as toppings. I tried the cocoa rust shake and it was refreshing. Would love to visit this place again soon!\n",
      "Nayan Jha 5 Today i visit 736 AD in Vijay Nagar   It's theme is very attractive and beautiful.  I tried fish finger, Chicken overloaded pizza and chicken lollipop.  Chicken lollipop was very good in taste like mouth watering  In main course i tried kadai chicken with butter naan it was amazing combo   Last but not least i tried brownie with ice cream.  Everything was amazing and service was really very amazing.   I recommend you to definitely visit there\n",
      "Rishi Agarwal 5 We went to 736 AD yesterday for a friend's birthday party and had a lot of fun there. We were a group of 6 and sat at the rooftop area as the other two floors were a little too cramped and noisy for our liking. We ordered many starters including the cheese garlic bread, chicken bruschetta, corn and cheese nuggets, honey chilli potato & classic chilli chicken. Out of these we loved the chicken bruschetta and corn and cheese nuggets the best and definitely will suggest them. Next we ordered the chicken steak sizzler and paneer tikka and an array of drinks to satiate our throats. While the paneer tikka tasted as one would ideally expect it to taste, the chicken steak came in a gravy sauce with a side of rice which was a surprise and not a pleasant one. On the other hand we also ordered 3 mocktails (Blue Lagoon, Water melon Tesco & Pina colado) out of which the Pina colado tasted the best! Apart from these we had also ordered a few shakes but none of them seemed exceptional. For main course we ordered a white sauce pasta and two pizzas (one veg one n. veg) all of which were decent. The pasta was not upto the mark in terms of taste and definitely could have been better while the pizzas (Smoky Chicken and Garden Veggie) both had very hard crusts but tasted well. Overall we had a nice experience at the restaurant and will definitely suggest the place for a nice hangout with friends!\n"

      "Akansha 1 It was an extremely pathetic experience at Themis. What i heard i did not experience that at all. Such unhygienic and poorly managed place. 0 rating from my side\n",

      "NihayatiBhukkad 5 The moment you enter, you are pleased by such a good ambiance; A buffet place serves great food with great taste. Starting from the starters till the main course, everything was perfect; not to forget their Welcome Chat and desserts too. We really enjoyed live music performance with live grilling on the table. Loved their services and staff behavior was very friendly. Kudos to their work.\n",
      "DILLI KE ZAAYKE 5 What a beautiful place to be! The ambience of the outdoor seating area is just amazing. The staff is also humble and polite. Talking of the food, we ordered paneer tikka for starters, dal makhni and garlic naan for main course. For dessert, we had gulab jamuns and black forest pastry. The paneer tikka was served on the table in a live tandoor. Nice concept. The dal makhni was flavourful and the naan was also wonderful. Gulab jamuns were so good, totally loved them. The small sized, cute looking black forest pastries were also nice. Overall a great experience.\n",
      "Ashmeet 5 Went on a lunch yesterday with my family at Themis barbeque which is in NSP.  We had non veg buffet there, barbeque items were amazing and snacks were up to the mark.  There was a great variety in main course as well. Everything was just great.  Desserts had my heart. The hot chocolate brownie was my favourite. Other items were also nice.  We had a great family time there with nice ambience too.\n"
